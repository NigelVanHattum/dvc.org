Documentation: <https://man.dvc.org/repro>

positional arguments:
  targets               Stages to reproduce. 'dvc.yaml' by default.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet.
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose.
  -f, --force           Reproduce even if dependencies were not changed.
  -s, --single-item     Reproduce only single data item without recursive
                        dependencies check.
  -c <path>, --cwd <path>
                        Directory within your repo to reproduce from. Note:
                        deprecated by `dvc --cd <path>`.
  -m, --metrics         Show metrics after reproduction.
  --dry                 Only print the commands that would be executed without
                        actually executing.
  -i, --interactive     Ask for confirmation before reproducing each stage.
  -p, --pipeline        Reproduce the whole pipeline that the specified stage
                        file belongs to.
  -P, --all-pipelines   Reproduce all pipelines in the repo.
  -R, --recursive       Reproduce all stages in the specified directory.
  --no-run-cache        Execute stage commands even if they have already been
                        run with the same command/dependencies/outputs/etc
                        before.
  --force-downstream    Reproduce all descendants of a changed stage even if
                        their direct dependencies didn't change.
  --no-commit           Don't put files/directories into cache.
  --downstream          Start from the specified stages when reproducing
                        pipelines.
  --pull                Try automatically pulling missing cache for outputs
                        restored from the run-cache.
  --glob                Allows targets containing shell-style wildcards.
